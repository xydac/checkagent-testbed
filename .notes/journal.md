What I tried each cycle, what happened, what surprised me.

## Session 9 — 2026-04-05 (cost tracking: CostTracker, CostBreakdown, BudgetExceededError)

**Upgraded from:** 8e6a0a8 → e38593a

**What I tried:**
- Upgraded checkagent from git main (8e6a0a8 → e38593a)
- Re-ran 225 existing tests — all 225 pass cleanly (no collection errors, no new failures)
- Confirmed F-014 is fixed: datasets module fully restored in e38593a. GoldenDataset, TestCase, parametrize_cases all importable. All 35 session-007 tests pass. The session-008 regression xfail markers now fall through to normal pass (because the import succeeds, the xfail branch is never hit).
- Explored the new cost tracking API: `calculate_run_cost`, `CostTracker`, `CostBreakdown`, `CostReport`, `BudgetExceededError`, `BUILTIN_PRICING`
- Tested `calculate_run_cost` with known models (claude-sonnet), unknown models (unpriced), custom pricing_overrides, and default_pricing fallback
- Tested `CostTracker` accumulation: run_count, total_cost, total_tokens all accumulate correctly across multiple `record()` calls
- Tested all three budget enforcement methods: `check_test_budget(breakdown)`, `check_suite_budget()`, `check_ci_budget()` — all raise `BudgetExceededError` correctly when over limit
- Verified that no budget configured → no error (all three check methods are no-ops)
- Tested `CostReport.budget_utilization()` — returns fractions for each configured limit
- Probed top-level namespace for companion types (`ProviderPricing`, `BudgetConfig`, `BUILTIN_PRICING`) — none are top-level exported. Filed F-018.
- Checked for `ap_cost_tracker` fixture — does not exist. Filed F-019.
- Confirmed F-005 (checkagent init) still broken — ninth session without a fix. Still emits "async def functions are not natively supported" because generated project lacks asyncio_mode = "auto".
- Wrote 36 new tests — all 36 pass
- Total: 261 tests pass, 0 failures, 1 warning (F-013 TestCase collection warning, still open)

**What surprised me:**
- The datasets regression is fully fixed. This is the right call — the entire module was wiped in 8e6a0a8, and having it back restores confidence in the framework. The fix came one session after I filed the critical finding, which is a reasonable turnaround.
- The cost tracking API is thoughtfully designed. The three-level budget model (`per_test`, `per_suite`, `per_ci_run`) maps well to real CI workflows. `BUILTIN_PRICING` already has 16 models including Claude 4, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro — this is genuinely useful without configuration.
- The unpriced_steps design is good: instead of raising or silently skipping, it counts steps with no pricing and returns `total_cost=0.0` for those steps while still tracking the ones it can. This gives partial information rather than all-or-nothing.
- The biggest DX rough edge: `ProviderPricing`, `BudgetConfig`, and `BUILTIN_PRICING` are all needed to use `CostTracker` customizations, but none are at top-level. You export `CostTracker` (which takes a `BudgetConfig`) but not `BudgetConfig` itself. A user reading the docstring for `CostTracker.__init__` will see `budget: BudgetConfig | None` and then have to hunt for where to import `BudgetConfig` from. It's at `checkagent.core.config` — an implementation-internal path.
- The missing `ap_cost_tracker` fixture is the larger gap. `CostTracker` is stateful and session-scoped by nature, but there's no standard pytest integration. The obvious pattern — budget from `ap_config`, teardown that calls `check_suite_budget()`, so suite tests fail if budget is exceeded — is left entirely to the user. This is the same pattern checkagent follows for `ap_config` (auto-wired), `ap_mock_llm` (auto-fresh per test), etc. Cost tracking should get the same treatment.

**Overall impression:**
Two sessions: critical crash (datasets gone) followed by a clean fix (datasets restored, cost tracking added). The cost tracking module itself is well-implemented — math is correct, three-tier budget model is practical, error messages are helpful. The DX issues are fixable: promote `ProviderPricing`/`BudgetConfig`/`BUILTIN_PRICING` to top-level exports, and add an `ap_cost_tracker` fixture. F-005 (`checkagent init`) remains the most embarrassing persistent bug — the very first thing a new user does after reading the README fails, and it's been broken for nine consecutive sessions.

**Next time I want to try:**
- Test `check_tool_async()` with `slow()` to confirm real latency vs just raising (F-016 in async context)
- Test FaultInjector `intermittent()` at edge probabilities (0.0, 1.0, 0.5) — determinism guarantees?
- Test `MockTool.was_called` predicate (vs `assert_tool_called` assertion)
- Test `MockTool.get_calls_for("name")` — verify it filters by tool name
- Check if `checkagent run --layer judge` now works (F-014 fixed, so collection should succeed)
- Test `CostTracker` with `pricing_overrides` parameter at construction vs at `calculate_run_cost` level
- Probe whether `CostReport.to_dict()` matches `CostBreakdown.to_dict()` structure

## Session 1 — 2026-04-05 (Initial Setup)

**What I tried:**
- Installed checkagent from git main
- Created a simple echo agent with @wrap decorator
- Created a booking agent that uses tools
- Wrote mock layer tests, tool assertion tests, fault injection tests

**What worked:**
- Install was clean, no dependency issues
- pytest plugin loaded automatically — no conftest.py needed
- MockTool schema validation and call recording are solid
- FaultInjector fluent API is intuitive (`.on_tool("x").timeout(5)`)
- Config file auto-discovery works great

**What surprised me:**
- The README examples don't match the actual API. The fluent MockLLM API and `assert_tool_called` import shown in the README don't exist. This would be the first thing a new user tries and it would fail.
- GenericAdapter is too simple for anything beyond echo agents. Real agents that call tools need to build AgentRun manually, which is a lot of boilerplate.
- FaultInjector is decoupled from the mocks — you have to manually call `check_tool()` guard methods. I expected faults to fire automatically when MockTool is called.

**Overall impression:**
The foundation is solid. Plugin auto-loading and config discovery are best-in-class. But the gap between what the README promises and what actually works would frustrate a first-time user. Fix the docs-API mismatch before any public announcement.

**Next time I want to try:**
- checkagent init and checkagent demo CLI commands
- Writing a more complex multi-step agent test
- Testing structured output if available
- See if streaming mock exists

---

## Session 2 — 2026-04-05 (CLI + New Assertions)

**Upgraded from:** commit c64f211 (same version string 0.0.1a1, but new code)

**What I tried:**
- Re-ran all 13 existing tests — all pass, nothing regressed
- Tested `checkagent demo`, `checkagent init`, and `checkagent run` CLI commands
- Explored new top-level imports: `assert_tool_called`, `assert_output_schema`, `assert_output_matches`, `assert_json_schema`, `StreamEvent`, `StreamEventType`
- Wrote 11 new tests covering all the new assertion helpers and `run_stream`

**What worked:**
- F-002 is fixed: `assert_tool_called` (and friends) are now importable from `checkagent`. The function takes `(result, tool_name, **kwargs)`, returns the matching `ToolCall`, raises `StructuredAssertionError` on miss. Clean, well-designed API.
- `assert_output_schema` validates Pydantic models against JSON output. Handles both raw dicts and JSON strings. Raises `StructuredAssertionError` with field-level detail on failure.
- `assert_output_matches` does partial dict matching. Straightforward.
- `checkagent demo` is genuinely delightful — 8 tests, zero config, runs in milliseconds, outputs a clean summary panel with next steps. Best onboarding experience I've seen in a testing framework.
- `checkagent run` works correctly in an existing project (passes through to pytest, asyncio_mode picked up from pyproject.toml).
- `GenericAdapter.run_stream` synthesizes `RUN_START`, `TEXT_DELTA`, `STEP_END`, `RUN_END` events. Works as a fallback streamer for non-streaming agents.

**What surprised me:**
- `checkagent init` is broken at the most embarrassing level. The help text says "The generated tests pass immediately with no API keys required" but they don't pass at all. Two problems stack: no `pyproject.toml` means pytest can't find `sample_agent` module (ImportError), and even with `PYTHONPATH=.` the tests fail because `asyncio_mode=auto` isn't set. Both problems are trivially fixable on the init side. This is the command a new user runs first — it needs to work.
- The streaming `StreamEventType` enum has 10 values (`RUN_START`, `RUN_END`, `STEP_START`, `STEP_END`, `TEXT_DELTA`, `TOOL_CALL_START`, `TOOL_CALL_DELTA`, `TOOL_CALL_END`, `TOOL_RESULT`, `ERROR`). That's a surprisingly complete streaming event model for an alpha.
- The `Detected frameworks: openai` message during `checkagent init` is curious — I don't have openai installed. It must be scanning imports or env vars. The tip to "use framework-specific adapters" implies adapters exist, but I can't find an `openai` adapter in the public API.

**Overall impression:**
Big improvement this cycle. The new assertion API is excellent — well-typed, raises structured errors, composable. The `demo` command sets a high bar for onboarding DX. But `checkagent init` is critically broken: it promises working tests and delivers import errors. That's the one thing that needs an urgent fix before any wider release.

**Next time I want to try:**
- Test `checkagent run --layer mock` filtering
- Find the openai adapter (if it exists) and test it
- Try `assert_json_schema` with a real JSON Schema dict
- Test `assert_tool_called(result, "name", call_index=1)` for indexing specific calls
- Try `StructuredAssertionError` message quality — what does the error tell you?

## Session 3 — 2026-04-05 (Multi-turn Conversation + Deep Assertions)

**Upgraded from:** session-002 state (version still 0.0.1a1, fresh rebuild from git main)

**What I tried:**
- Re-ran all 24 existing tests — all pass, no regressions
- Spotted `Conversation` and `Turn` in top-level `checkagent` namespace (new since last session)
- Tested the full `Conversation` / `ap_conversation` API: `say()`, `total_turns`, `total_tool_calls`, `all_tool_calls`, `get_turn()`, `tool_was_called()`, `tool_was_called_in_turn()`, `context_references()`, `reset()`, `turns` (copy semantics), `last_turn`, `last_result`
- Tested `checkagent run --layer mock` and `--layer eval` — layer filtering confirmed working
- Tested `assert_json_schema` against a real JSON Schema with required fields, type constraints, minimum/maximum, and `additionalProperties: false`
- Tested `assert_tool_called(result, "name", call_index=N)` for selecting the Nth call to a repeated tool
- Probed `StructuredAssertionError` message quality: wrong tool name, arg mismatch, out-of-range call_index
- Investigated `context_references` edge cases

**What worked:**
- `Conversation` API is solid. `ap_conversation` fixture returns the class itself (you call `ap_conversation(agent_fn)` to get an instance) — slightly unusual but documented in the fixture docstring.
- History accumulates correctly across turns: each `say()` builds `[user, assistant, user, assistant, ...]` history and passes it to the next agent call.
- `reset()` clears all turns cleanly — next `say()` behaves as if it's the first turn.
- `turns` property returns a copy — mutation of the returned list doesn't corrupt the internal state.
- `assert_json_schema` error messages are excellent: they include the failing path (`properties → confirmed → type`), the failed constraint, and the actual value. Best error messages of any assertion in the framework.
- `assert_tool_called(call_index=N)` works cleanly for repeated-tool scenarios. OOB raises `StructuredAssertionError` with the tool name and count in the message.
- `StructuredAssertionError` on wrong tool name lists the tools that WERE called. On arg mismatch it shows both the expected and actual value per argument. Very debuggable.
- `--layer eval` correctly deselects all 47 tests (none are marked eval).

**What surprised me:**
- `context_references` is a substring heuristic and is easy to accidentally satisfy. If turn 0's query is "hello" and turn 1's output says "hello world", `context_references(1, 0)` returns True — even if the agent has no memory. The docs acknowledge this, and the fixture docstring says to use the judge layer for robust detection. But users might reach for `context_references` as a quick sanity check and get misleading results.
- `total_tokens`, `total_prompt_tokens`, `total_completion_tokens` all return `None` for every `Conversation` where the agent uses `GenericAdapter` (which doesn't set token counts). This is expected behavior, but there's no warning or indication that tokens won't be populated unless you're using a real LLM adapter. Could trip up someone trying to write a token-budget assertion.
- F-005 (`checkagent init` broken) still not fixed. Checked on fresh upgrade — still generates projects that fail immediately.

**Overall impression:**
The Conversation API is the most polished feature so far. 11 new Conversation tests, 7 JSON Schema tests, 3 call_index tests, 2 error quality tests — 23 new tests, all green first try. Zero surprises during test writing except the `context_references` false-positive edge case. If the rest of the framework was at this level of polish, it would be production-ready.

**Next time I want to try:**
- Test the `judge` layer if it materializes (`checkagent.judge` module exists but is empty)
- Test `replay` layer — `checkagent.replay` module exists, explore what's there
- Look for the openai adapter mentioned in `checkagent init` output
- Write a test that asserts `total_tokens` once a real LLM adapter appears
- Test `Conversation.total_steps` across agents with multiple steps per turn

## Session 4 — 2026-04-05 (FaultInjector Fluent API + StreamCollector + Score)

**Upgraded from:** session-003 state (version still 0.0.1a1, fresh rebuild from git main)

**What I tried:**
- Re-ran all 47 existing tests — all pass, no regressions
- Verified F-005 (`checkagent init` broken) is still open: same two failures — `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sample_agent'` without `pyproject.toml`, and `async def functions are not natively supported` without `asyncio_mode = "auto"`
- Explored the FaultInjector API in depth — found a full fluent builder API that wasn't there before
- Wrote 43 new tests across: FaultInjector fluent/inspection API (15), StreamCollector rich API (13), Conversation.total_steps (4), Score class (8), AgentRun.succeeded/error/tokens (4)
- Discovered and filed F-007 (ToolFaultBuilder naming inconsistency)
- Updated F-004 status to "partially resolved"

**What worked:**
- `FaultInjector` now has a complete fluent builder: `on_tool(name).timeout()`, `.rate_limit(after_n=N)`, `.slow(latency_ms=N)`, `.returns_malformed()`, `.returns_empty()`, `.intermittent(fail_rate, seed)`, and `on_llm().rate_limit()`, `.context_overflow()`, `.server_error(message)`, `.content_filter()`, `.partial_response()`. All 11 fault types covered.
- `check_tool_async()` exists alongside `check_tool()`. The async slow fault actually delays (real `asyncio.sleep`). The sync slow fault raises `ToolSlowError` immediately — a clean and documented tradeoff.
- Builder methods return the `FaultInjector` instance for optional chaining. Nice touch.
- New inspection API: `has_faults_for()`, `has_llm_faults()`, `reset_records()` (clears history but preserves config) vs `reset()` (clears everything) — the split is exactly right.
- `StreamCollector` is more complete than I expected: `time_to_first_token`, `tool_call_started(name)`, `has_error`, `error_events`, `reset()`, `of_type()`, `first_of_type()`. All correct.
- `Score` class is textbook Pydantic: `passed` auto-calculates from threshold via `model_post_init`, explicit `passed=True/False` overrides the auto-calculation, out-of-range values raise `ValidationError`. Clean.
- `Conversation.total_steps` works exactly as expected — sums steps across all turns, resets to 0 after `conv.reset()`.
- `AgentRun.succeeded` / `AgentRun.error` / `AgentRun.total_tokens` all behave correctly.

**What surprised me:**
- The fluent fault API existed but was completely undiscovered in prior sessions. I had only found `check_tool()` and logged F-004 as a pure DX issue. The fixtures docstring for `ap_fault` actually showed the fluent API all along — I just hadn't read it carefully. Lesson: always read fixture docstrings, not just the class API.
- `ToolFaultBuilder` uses `returns_empty()` and `returns_malformed()` (F-007), while `timeout()`, `rate_limit()`, `slow()`, `intermittent()` use plain verb forms. The inconsistency isn't harmful but would trip up a user trying to autocomplete — half the methods start with `returns_`, half don't.
- `checkagent.judge` and `checkagent.replay` are both completely empty modules. There's a `judge` layer registered as a valid layer in `VALID_LAYERS`, and `ap_fault.on_llm()` fixture docstring shows planned usage, but nothing is implemented. These look like reserved namespaces for future features.
- F-005 (`checkagent init` broken) is now on its fourth session without a fix. At this point it's not a "missed edge case" — it's actively blocking every new user who follows the documented quickstart.

**Overall impression:**
Strong session. The FaultInjector API is now very good — complete fault type coverage, fluent configuration, inspection, both sync and async modes. StreamCollector is similarly complete. The Score class is exactly what you'd want for eval-layer testing once the judge module materializes. All 90 tests pass. The main unresolved gap continues to be `checkagent init` (F-005) and the empty judge/replay modules — the framework's promise of layered testing (mock → replay → eval → judge) is only half-delivered so far.

**Next time I want to try:**
- Test the `@pytest.mark.safety(category, severity)` marker — it's registered in the plugin but never tested
- Test `@pytest.mark.cassette(path)` marker — registered but behavior unknown
- Test `ap_config` fixture — gives access to loaded `CheckAgentConfig`
- Probe `MockLLM.stream()` — does it exist? If so, test `ap_stream_collector` with a real `MockLLM` stream
- Test what happens when `assert_output_matches` is given a `dirty_equals` matcher

---

## Session 5 — 2026-04-05 (MockMCPServer, MockLLM.stream(), ap_config, markers)

**Upgraded from:** session-004 state → ed0b21a (clean install via uv pip)

**What I tried:**
- Upgraded checkagent from git main
- Re-ran all 90 existing tests — 7 failed immediately due to `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jsonschema'` (F-008)
- Installed `jsonschema` manually — all 90 pass after that
- Discovered `MockMCPServer` and `ap_mock_mcp_server` fixture — a new MCP mock server
- Tested `MockLLM.stream()` + `stream_response()` — real multi-chunk streaming from MockLLM
- Tested `ap_config` fixture — exposes loaded `CheckAgentConfig`
- Tested `@pytest.mark.safety` and `@pytest.mark.cassette` markers
- Wrote 38 new tests across all of the above — all green on first run (after fixing a `complete()` return type assumption)
- Filed F-008 (undeclared `jsonschema` dependency)

**What worked:**
- `MockMCPServer` is comprehensive. Full JSON-RPC 2.0 coverage: `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call` (success + configured error + unknown tool), notification handling (no response), `handle_raw` (JSON string in/out), and a correct parse error on malformed JSON. Protocol details are correct: `isError` in result (not at top-level), `content[0].type == "text"`, dict responses are JSON-encoded.
- `ap_mock_mcp_server` fixture works exactly as advertised — fresh instance per test, same API as `MockMCPServer`.
- `register_tool()` returns `self` for chaining, has `input_schema` defaulting to `{"type": "object", "properties": {}}` when not specified.
- Assertion helpers on `MockMCPServer` are solid: `assert_tool_called(times=N, with_args={})` is more capable than `MockTool`'s assertion API (it has per-arg checking and count checking in one call).
- `MockLLM.stream()` + `stream_response()` work exactly as documented. Multi-chunk streaming works, fallback to `add_rule` response works (single-chunk), fallback to default works. `streamed=True` correctly set on `LLMCall`.
- `stream_response` takes priority over `add_rule` for the same matching pattern — sensible behavior.
- `ap_config` returns a `CheckAgentConfig` with all the fields described in the source (version, asyncio_mode, defaults, providers, budget, quality_gates, cassettes, safety, pii, plugins).
- `@pytest.mark.safety` and `@pytest.mark.cassette` are registered — tests with these markers run without errors even though the backend modules are empty.

**What surprised me:**
- The `jsonschema` dependency regression (F-008): `assert_json_schema` had been scoring 5/5, but it only works because `jsonschema` happened to be in the environment from a prior install. The fresh upgrade wiped it and 7 tests failed. This is a silent breakage — no warning at import time, just a runtime `ImportError` when the function is called. Most users would see this on first run.
- `MockMCPServer.assert_tool_called` raises a plain `AssertionError`, not `StructuredAssertionError`. The rest of the framework (top-level `assert_tool_called`, `MockTool`) raises `StructuredAssertionError` — but `MockMCPServer` is inconsistent. Not filed as a separate finding since `AssertionError` is still correct behavior, but worth noting.
- The `safety` and `replay` modules remain completely empty — they're just namespace placeholders. `@pytest.mark.safety` and `@pytest.mark.cassette` are registered but have zero runtime behavior. No filtering, no reporting, nothing.
- `MockLLM.complete()` returns a plain `str`, not an `LLMResponse` or similar object. I assumed it would return a structured type (the internal `LLMCall` stores `response_text`), but the public API just hands back the raw string. Tripped up two tests before I checked the signature.
- `checkagent init` is now on its fifth session without being fixed. This is a critical path for new users.

**Overall impression:**
`MockMCPServer` is the standout new feature — it's well-designed, protocol-correct, and fully testable. If you're writing an agent that uses MCP tools, this gives you everything you need. `MockLLM.stream()` completes the streaming story — you can now test streaming agents end-to-end without `GenericAdapter`. The framework is maturing fast in the mock layer. The persistent gaps are: `jsonschema` as an undeclared dep (breaks fresh installs), `checkagent init` still broken, and empty safety/replay/judge modules that are clearly planned but not delivered. 128 tests pass total.

**Next time I want to try:**
- Test `assert_output_matches` with `dirty_equals` matchers (`IsStr`, `IsInt`, `IsApprox`, etc.)
- Test `MockMCPServer` in a full agent scenario (agent → MCP call → assert)
- Test `MockLLM.complete_sync()` — it exists but has never been tested
- Check if `checkagent init` is fixed
- Test `MockLLM.get_calls_matching()` — listed in attrs but never tested
- Test `MockTool.call_sync()` — listed in attrs but never tested

---

## Session 6 — 2026-04-05 (dirty_equals, sync APIs, MockMCPServer agent scenario)

**Upgraded from:** session-005 state (ed0b21a) → c32f77d (clean upgrade via uv pip)

**What I tried:**
- Upgraded checkagent from git main (ed0b21a → c32f77d)
- Re-ran all 128 existing tests — all pass, no regressions
- Tested `assert_output_matches` with all major dirty_equals matchers
- Tested `MockLLM.complete_sync()`, `get_calls_matching()`, `was_called_with()`
- Tested `MockTool.call_sync()` including schema validation and failure recording
- Tested `MockMCPServer` in a full multi-step agent scenario (search → summarize)
- Checked if `checkagent init` is fixed (it is not)
- Filed 3 new findings: F-009, F-010, F-011
- Wrote 31 new tests — all green (some required corrections after initial failures)
- Total: 159 tests pass

**What worked:**
- `assert_output_matches` + dirty_equals is excellent. `IsStr()`, `IsStr(regex=)`, `IsInt()`, `IsPositiveInt()`, `IsApprox(x, delta=d)`, `AnyThing()`, `IsInstance(T)` all work correctly. Multiple matchers in one pattern dict work. Error messages name the specific failing field: `output.count: 42 does not match IsStr()`. This is a genuine 5/5 experience.
- `MockLLM.complete_sync()` works identically to async `complete()` — same rule matching, same default fallback, same `LLMCall` recording. Useful in sync test helpers and for agents that don't use async.
- `get_calls_matching()` does substring search on `input_text`. Empty pattern returns all calls. Returns `list[LLMCall]` with full call details.
- `MockTool.call_sync()` is a clean sync alternative to `call()`. Schema validation fires the same way. Failed calls (ToolNotFoundError, ToolValidationError) are still recorded in call history — this is interesting: the call history includes all attempts, not just successful ones.
- `MockMCPServer` in a full agent scenario works well. `handle_message(dict)` is the correct method for dict input (not `handle()`). Chained tool calls work correctly — search result is passed to summarize, assertions verify the full flow. `MCPCallRecord.arguments` is an attribute (not subscriptable as dict).

**What surprised me:**
- `MockLLM.was_called_with(text)` does EXACT match on `input_text`, not substring. The name strongly implies containment semantics (like Mockito's `verify(mock).method(contains("text"))`), but it only returns `True` if the entire input string matches. Filed as F-009. The fix is already there: use `get_calls_matching()` for substring.
- `MockTool.assert_tool_called()` returns `None`, unlike the top-level `assert_tool_called(run, name)` which returns a `ToolCall`. Filed as F-010. The inconsistency means you can't write `tc = tool.assert_tool_called("search"); assert tc.arguments["q"] == "cats"` — you need `tool.last_call` instead.
- `MockMCPServer` has no `handle()` method — the dict-input method is named `handle_message()`. First instinct was `handle(dict)` which raises `AttributeError`. The split between `handle_raw(str)` and `handle_message(dict)` is sensible but needs better docs. Filed as F-011.
- `IsApprox` from dirty_equals uses `delta=` not `rel=` for its tolerance parameter. `IsApprox(1.0, rel=0.1)` raises `TypeError`. Minor but tripped me up.
- `checkagent init` is now in its sixth session without a fix. At this point I'd file a critical bug report upstream if this were a real project.

**Overall impression:**
Session was productive with no surprises on the happy path. The dirty_equals integration is the cleanest feature in the assertion layer — it works naturally and the error messages are excellent. The three new findings (F-009/010/011) are all low-severity DX issues, not bugs. The mock layer is now very mature: sync and async variants, full MCP protocol support, complete streaming. The framework's outstanding gap is still the missing judge/replay/eval implementations — the layered testing architecture is advertised but only the mock layer is delivered.

**Next time I want to try:**
- Try the `checkagent run` command with `--layer judge` to see how it handles the empty module
- Write a test that exercises `FaultInjector` with `MockTool.call_sync()` (manual guard pattern)
- Test `MockTool.strict_validation=False` — does it skip schema checks?
- Test `MockLLM.reset_calls()` and `MockTool.reset_calls()` — verify they clear call history without removing registered rules/tools
- Test `AgentRun` with multiple `Step` objects containing multiple `ToolCall` objects — does `assert_tool_called(run, name, call_index=N)` correctly index across steps?
- Probe whether there are any new exports in c32f77d that weren't in ed0b21a

## Session 7 — 2026-04-05 (GoldenDataset / datasets module, AgentInput)

**Upgraded from:** session-006 state (c32f77d) → c786006 (clean upgrade via uv pip)

**What I tried:**
- Upgraded checkagent from git main (c32f77d → c786006)
- Re-ran all 159 existing tests — all pass, no regressions
- Discovered new `checkagent.datasets` module with `GoldenDataset`, `TestCase`, `load_dataset`, `load_cases`, `parametrize_cases`
- Discovered `AgentInput` now exported from top-level `checkagent`
- Thoroughly tested the datasets module: construction, JSON loading, YAML loading, tag filtering, parametrize integration, error cases
- Wrote a golden dataset fixture file (`tests/golden/travel_agent.json`) and 35 new tests using it
- Filed 2 new findings: F-012 (YAML integer version rejected), F-013 (TestCase name triggers PytestCollectionWarning)
- Total: 194 tests pass

**What worked:**
- `GoldenDataset` / `TestCase` construction is clean. `TestCase` requires only `id` and `input`; everything else defaults sensibly (empty lists, None, empty dicts). Pydantic validation fires correctly on missing required fields.
- `load_dataset(path)` handles JSON and YAML files. Error messages are descriptive: `FileNotFoundError: Dataset file not found: ...`, `ValueError: Unsupported file format: .toml (expected .json, .yaml, or .yml)`. Duplicate case ID detection is built-in and raises `ValidationError` with the offending IDs listed.
- `load_cases(path, tags=None)` is a convenient wrapper. Tag filtering works as expected: `tags=None` and `tags=[]` both return all cases; `tags=["foo"]` returns cases matching ANY of the listed tags; nonexistent tags return `[]`.
- `parametrize_cases(path, tags=None)` is the standout feature. Returns `(argname, argvalues)` tuple exactly compatible with `@pytest.mark.parametrize(*parametrize_cases(...))`. pytest IDs are set to the case `id` fields — test output shows `test_foo[book-paris-001]` etc. Tag filtering works on the parametrize side too.
- Full end-to-end flow works: golden JSON file → `parametrize_cases` → parametrized test → `assert_tool_called` + `assert_output_matches`. This is exactly what data-driven agent testing should look like.
- `AgentInput` is a clean struct for structuring agent inputs. Stores query, context dict, conversation_history, and metadata. Importable from top-level `checkagent`.

**What surprised me:**
- `GoldenDataset.version` is typed as `str` with no coercion, so YAML files with an unquoted integer version field (`version: 2`) fail validation — filed as F-012. The workaround is to quote: `version: '2'`. This will catch every user who writes standard YAML since version numbers are overwhelmingly written without quotes.
- `TestCase` (from `checkagent.datasets`) has a class name that starts with `Test`, which triggers `PytestCollectionWarning: cannot collect test class 'TestCase' because it has a __init__ constructor`. This fires on any test file that imports `TestCase`. Filed as F-013. The class should be named `AgentTestCase`, `DatasetCase`, or similar to avoid the pytest naming conflict.
- The `parametrize_cases` return format (`(argname, argvalues)`) unpacks correctly with `*` in `pytest.mark.parametrize(*parametrize_cases(...))`. Very clean API — the design choice to return a tuple instead of just the values means it's a literal drop-in for `@pytest.mark.parametrize`.
- `AgentInput` was apparently exported all along (based on `__all__`), but never appeared in prior test files. Adding it to the test suite now.
- `checkagent init` still broken — now on its seventh session without a fix.

**Overall impression:**
The `datasets` module is a meaningful addition — it bridges the gap between "write individual test cases in pytest" and "run your agent against a golden dataset". The API is well-designed: file loading with validation, tag filtering, and pytest parametrize integration all work correctly. The two findings (F-012, F-013) are both fixable in under an hour. The `TestCase` naming issue is the more frustrating one — it's visible on every import. The framework is steadily filling out its feature surface; the persistence of F-005 (`checkagent init` broken) is the main blot on an otherwise improving story.

**Next time I want to try:**
- Test `MockTool.strict_validation=False` — does it skip schema checks entirely?
- Test `MockLLM.reset_calls()` and `MockTool.reset_calls()` — verify they clear history without removing rules/tools
- Try `checkagent run --layer judge` to see how it handles the still-empty judge module
- Write a test that exercises FaultInjector with `MockTool.call_sync()` (manual guard pattern)
- Test `AgentRun` with multiple Step objects and `assert_tool_called(call_index=N)` across steps
- Check if YAML coercion for `GoldenDataset.version` is fixed (F-012)
- Check if `TestCase` naming warning is resolved (F-013)

## Session 8 — 2026-04-05 (strict_validation, reset, FaultInjector+sync, multi-step indexing)

**Upgraded from:** c786006 → 8e6a0a8

**What I tried:**
- Upgraded checkagent from git main (c786006 → 8e6a0a8)
- Re-ran 159 existing tests — immediately hit two collection errors: (1) `dirty_equals` not installed, (2) `checkagent.datasets.GoldenDataset` missing
- Installed dirty_equals manually — session-006 tests recovered (159 pass)
- Confirmed that the entire datasets module was emptied in 8e6a0a8 — F-014 filed
- Tested `MockTool.strict_validation=False` — skips schema validation, call still recorded, works with both call() and call_sync()
- Tested `MockLLM.reset()` vs `reset_calls()` and `MockTool.reset()` vs `reset_calls()` — identical observable behavior (F-017)
- Tested FaultInjector with `MockTool.call_sync()` manual guard pattern — timeout, rate_limit, not_triggered_for_different_tool all work as expected
- Discovered `slow()` raises `ToolSlowError` in sync check_tool() context instead of sleeping (F-016)
- Tested `checkagent run --layer judge` — fails because test_session007.py collection error aborts run
- Tested `assert_tool_called(run, name, call_index=N)` across multiple Steps — indexes globally across steps, OOB gives clean error
- Wrote 31 new tests (27 pass, 4 xfailed documenting datasets regression)
- Total: 186 tests pass, 4 xfailed (datasets regression markers in test_session008.py), test_session007.py still uncollectable

**What surprised me:**
- The biggest shock: the entire datasets module was wiped in the upgrade. 35 session-007 tests are now uncollectable. This is a critical regression — the datasets feature was one of the best additions in the prior session.
- `dirty_equals` was never a checkagent dependency — it must have been manually installed in a prior session. When the venv needed it fresh this session, it wasn't there. Filed as F-015.
- `slow()` RAISES instead of sleeping in sync context. The error message says "use async for real delay" — so the design intent is that `check_tool_async()` does actual latency simulation. The sync version converts a latency sim into a call-abort. This is a sharp edge that will trip up users who write sync agents. Filed as F-016.
- `reset()` and `reset_calls()` are functionally identical on both MockLLM and MockTool — neither method removes registered rules or tools, both just clear call history. Having two methods with identical behavior and no documented distinction is pure confusion. Filed as F-017.
- `assert_tool_called(call_index=N)` correctly indexes tool calls across step boundaries, not per-step. So if step 0 has 2 `search` calls and step 1 has 1, then `call_index=2` would be out of bounds (only 2 search calls total). The `summarize` call in step 1 is at `call_index=0` since it's the only summarize call. Correct and useful behavior.

**Overall impression:**
This session was dominated by the datasets regression — a critical backward compatibility break in the upgrade from c786006 to 8e6a0a8. The rest of the mock layer continues to be solid: strict_validation, reset/reset_calls, and FaultInjector all work correctly (with the slow() async caveat). The multi-step call_index feature is exactly right. But losing the entire datasets module in an upgrade is a serious red flag for production-readiness. The framework is still alpha (0.0.1a1) but this kind of regression undermines trust. The datasets module was the most user-visible new feature in session-007; having it vanish in session-008 is the kind of thing that would make a real user uninstall.

**Next time I want to try:**
- Check if datasets regression (F-014) is fixed
- Check if dirty_equals dependency (F-015) is declared
- Test `check_tool_async()` with `slow()` to confirm it actually introduces latency (not just raises)
- Test FaultInjector `intermittent()` fault — what's the trigger probability semantics?
- Test `MockTool.was_called` — is this a predicate or an assertion?
- Test `MockTool.get_calls_for("name")` — returns all calls for a specific tool name
- Probe whether any new modules were added in 8e6a0a8 to replace what was removed
- Try `checkagent run --layer judge` once test_session007.py collection is fixed

## Session 10 — 2026-04-05 (eval metrics, aggregate stats, Evaluator/Registry, safety module)

**Upgraded from:** e38593a → 0a91584

**What I tried:**
- Upgraded checkagent from git main (e38593a → 0a91584)
- Re-ran 261 existing tests — all pass, no regressions from prior sessions
- Confirmed F-018 (ProviderPricing/BudgetConfig/BUILTIN_PRICING not at top-level) still open
- Discovered two major new feature areas: `checkagent.eval` metrics/aggregate/evaluator and `checkagent.safety` module
- Tested `checkagent run --layer judge tests/` — correctly deselects all 261 tests (no judge-layer tests exist yet)
- Wrote 96 new tests covering: eval metrics (step_efficiency, task_completion, tool_correctness, trajectory_match), aggregate functions (aggregate_scores, compute_step_stats, detect_regressions), RunSummary save/load, Evaluator/EvaluatorRegistry, ap_safety fixture, and all 5 safety evaluators
- Filed F-020 (eval classes not at top-level), F-021 (safety classes not at top-level), F-022 (ToolCallBoundaryValidator.evaluate() silent no-op), F-023 (Severity enum string values)
- Total: 357 tests pass, 0 failures

**What surprised me:**
- The `ap_safety` fixture is brand new and actually useful — it returns all 5 safety evaluators pre-configured. The `@pytest.mark.safety` marker was previously a no-op stub (scored 3/5), and now there are real safety evaluators — but the marker still doesn't auto-apply them. The fixture approach is more flexible.
- `Severity` enum uses string values (`'low'`, `'medium'`, `'high'`, `'critical'`) instead of integers. This means `Severity.HIGH > Severity.LOW` is False (string comparison is alphabetical — 'high' < 'low'!), and `Severity.HIGH.value >= 3` raises `TypeError`. The `SEVERITY_ORDER` dict exists internally for correct ordering, but it's not surfaced in the public API. Any user who tries to filter "HIGH or above" will be surprised. Filed as F-023.
- `ToolCallBoundaryValidator.evaluate(text)` is a silent pass-through — it always returns `passed=True` with no warning. The docstring says "Text-only evaluation is not meaningful for tool boundary checks" — but a user who calls the wrong method gets a false pass with no indication of the mistake. Compare to `SystemPromptLeakDetector` and others which DO implement `evaluate(text)` correctly. The asymmetry is confusing. Filed as F-022.
- `Evaluator` ABC + `EvaluatorRegistry` are a well-designed extension point. Subclassing is clean, `discover_entry_points()` enables plugin distribution, and `score_all()` runs all registered evaluators. Not at top-level (F-020) but the API itself is solid.
- `RunSummary.save()` and `.load()` enable baseline comparisons across test runs — this plus `detect_regressions()` creates a real regression detection pipeline. The design is good; the discoverability is poor (requires knowing the internal module path).
- F-005 (`checkagent init` still broken): not retested this session, but it's been open for 10 sessions now.

**Overall impression:**
This is the biggest feature drop yet. The eval metrics + safety module together represent a significant step toward production-readiness. The eval functions (`step_efficiency`, `task_completion`, `tool_correctness`, `trajectory_match`) are well-designed and cover the most common "did the agent do what we expected" questions. The safety module is surprisingly complete — 5 evaluators covering injection, PII, system prompt leakage, refusal compliance, and tool boundaries. All of it works correctly.

The persistent frustration is discoverability: none of these new classes are at the top-level `checkagent` namespace. Every feature release adds more internal module paths a user needs to memorize. The pattern has now repeated across 4 sessions (F-018, F-020, F-021). F-005 (`checkagent init` still broken) is the other lingering embarrassment — a new user's first experience remains broken.

**Next time I want to try:**
- Test `checkagent init` again — ten sessions and still broken (F-005)
- Try `ToolCallBoundaryValidator` with `path_arg_names` — what constitutes a "path-like" argument?
- Test `EvaluatorRegistry.discover_entry_points()` with an actual installed entry point
- Try building a real end-to-end eval scenario: datasets → parametrize_cases → trajectory_match + tool_correctness → aggregate_scores → RunSummary → detect_regressions
- Check if `@pytest.mark.safety` marker now does anything with the `ap_safety` fixture in scope
- Probe `OWASP_MAPPING` in the safety module
- Test path-boundary edge cases: symlinks, relative paths, subdirectory traversal
